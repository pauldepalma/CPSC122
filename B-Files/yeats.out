From fernwood to the lake,
Where dips the rocky highland
There sits a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy river rats.
There we store our faerie vats,
Full of berries and ripest stolen cherries.

Come away, O human child,
To the waters and the wild,
With a Faerie hand in hand,
The world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand.

--W.B. Yeats, The Stolen Child
