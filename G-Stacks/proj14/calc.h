  /*
  pre:  invoked from constructor 
  post: 1. space for inFix expression is dynamically allocated 
	2. inFix is a copy of argv[1] except:
           Beginning with 'A', upper case alphabetic characters are substituted for digit 
	   strings. Numbers corresponding to digit strikngs are stored in valueTbl. 
	   valueIdx is appropriately incremented. 

           Example: ((322+12)*12) becomes ((A+B)*C)
	            valueTbl becomes: [322 12 12 0 0 ... 0] 
		    valueIdx becomes 3, the next available position in valueTbl.
		    Notice that when the ASCII value of 'A'  is
		    substracted from the operands, we get the get the index
		    to the value of the operand stored in the value table.
		    So, for the second operand above, 'B' - 'A' = 1
		    valueTbl[1] == 12

		    The value table is used in evaluating expressions.  The 
		    above inFix will ultimately (in project 13) 
		    become this postfix expression:

		    AB+C* 

		    During evaluation, A and B are pushed onto the stack:

		    B
		    A

		    When + is read, A and B are popped and their corresponding values
		    are read from valueTbl. 322+12 is computed and its sum is placed 
		    in the next available position in valueTbl: 
                    
	            [322 12 12 334 0 ... 0] 

		    The upper alhabetic character, corresponding to the position of 
		    344, 'D', is pushed onto the stack.  valueIdx is incremented by
		    1.

	  This function invokes FindLast, below. 
          Imagine traversing argv[1] until you 
          see a digit.  You need to find the last digit in the sequence.  The 
          collection of such digits can be transformed to an integer and stored
          in valueTable.  FindLast returns the index of the last digit in 
          the current digit string being examined.
  
          Example: (912+12)
          Suppose current index = 1, meaning we are looking digit '9'.  FindLast,
          below, returns, 3, meaning the last digit in the current digit string is 2.
