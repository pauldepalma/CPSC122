WHERE DIPS THE ROCKY HIGHLAND
FROM FERNWOOD TO THE LAKE,
THERE SITS A LEAFY ISLAND
WHERE FLAPPING HERONS WAKE
THE DROWSY RIVER RATS.
THERE WE STORE OUR FAERIE VATS,
FULL OF BERRIES AND RIPEST STOLEN CHERRIES.

COME AWAY, O HUMAN CHILD,
TO THE WATERS AND THE WILD,
WITH A FAERIE HAND IN HAND,
THE WORLD'S MORE FULL OF WEEPING
THAN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

--W.B. YEATS, THE STOLEN CHILD
