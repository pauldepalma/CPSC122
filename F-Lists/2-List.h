//A work in progress: 10/13

/*
Name: Paul De Palma
Class: CPSC 122, Section 1
Date Submitted: 10/19/2025 
Assignment: N/A 
Description: Adds three six functions and a tail pointer to 1-list.h
   List(List &ListIn), the copy constructor. The new class is a copy of ListIn
   int InsertItem(int pos,itemType), a function that inserts a node at a particular position 
   int DeleteItem(const itemType target), a function that deletes all items in a list
   
   //These are done using the tail pointer.  List traversal is not necessary
   void PutItemT(const itemType itemIn);
   itemType GetItemT() const;
   void DeleteItemT();
   
   Adds a tail pointer that is NULL if the list is empty, else  points to the last node in the list.
   Notice that if the list is empty, PutItemT and PutItemH are identical, but the current PutItemH 
   to be modified to account for the tail pointer.
   
   Write the functions in this order:
   GetItemT, PutItemT, DeleteItemT, InsertItemT, DeleteItem2, Copy constructor.
